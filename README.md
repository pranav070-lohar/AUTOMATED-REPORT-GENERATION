DESCRIPTION:
Task 2 focused on building a Python script that reads structured data from a file, performs basic analysis, and generates a well-formatted PDF report. This task simulates real-world reporting processes in business, finance, and education, where data is processed and shared as downloadable documents.

The file input could be a CSV, Excel, or text file. We used Python libraries like pandas for data handling and analysis, and either FPDF or ReportLab for PDF generation. First, we read the file and cleaned the data. Then, we computed key statistics like sum, average, min, max, and percentages, depending on the dataset.

After analyzing the data, we created a professional PDF report using FPDF. This included a title, section headers, formatted tables, and even charts (optional using matplotlib export to image). We used font styles, sizes, and borders to structure the content neatly.

To make it reusable, the script accepted any file with the expected format and dynamically built the report based on its contents. Proper error handling ensured smooth execution even if the file was missing or malformed. We also added a timestamp and filename to the generated PDF for documentation purposes.

This task was valuable in learning how to automate repetitive reporting tasksâ€”essential in fields like data entry, administration, HR, and analytics. It also introduced the importance of formatting, structuring, and delivering output that others can read and interpret effectively.
